<h3>1. Introduction to Crudzilla&#39;s Products and License Terms.</h3>

<p><strong>1.1 What&#39;s Included in &quot;Software&quot;.</strong> Over time Crudzilla will offer many different software products for download, including the Crudzilla Web Application Builder (CWAB) platform product. &quot;<strong>Software</strong>&quot; means any Crudzilla product that End User orders from Crudzilla (or a Crudzilla Expert, as described below) and downloads from Crudzilla. The term also includes (a) related documentation, (b) any Updates (defined below) to the Software, (c) any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or Internet-based components of the Software provided by Crudzilla (but not third parties) (&quot;<strong>Supplementary Software</strong>&quot;), and (d) any third party software embedded in or provided with Crudzilla&#39;s software (&quot;<strong>Embedded Software</strong>&quot;). End User&#39;s detailed rights to use Software are in Section 2 below. To be clear, any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or other code offered by third parties (through Crudzilla or otherwise) or created by End User itself are not &quot;Software&quot;, and Crudzilla is not responsible for and does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for those items.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 What&#39;s Included in &quot;Hosted Services&quot;.</strong> &quot;<strong>Hosted Services</strong>&quot; include any Crudzilla online services products that End User orders, which can include &quot;OnDemand&quot; versions of Crudzilla Software products, and other online services provided by Crudzilla. &quot;Hosted Services&quot; always means the version of the Hosted Services as described in Crudzilla&#39;s then-current product descriptions. End User&#39;s detailed rights to use Hosted Services are in Section 3 below.</p>

<p><strong>1.3 The &quot;Products&quot;.</strong> This Agreement uses &quot;<strong>Products</strong>&quot; to refer to the Software and/or the Hosted Services.</p>

<p><strong>1.4 Crudzilla&#39;s Maintenance Offerings.</strong> For additional fees, Crudzilla offers &quot;<strong>Maintenance</strong>&quot; to End Users as described at <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+Offerings">http://crudzilla.com/support-offerings</a>. Maintenance includes (1) any generally released updates, upgrades, patches, and bug fixes for the Software (&quot;<strong>Updates</strong>&quot;) when and if generally released at Crudzilla&#39;s sole discretion, (2) web-based support and phone support (depending on End User&#39;s support level) as described in the link above, and (3) other support features as described in the link above.</p>

<p><strong>1.5 Limits on Authorized Users.</strong> When buying a license to the Software or a subscription to the Hosted Services, End User pays fees for a specific number of users, which are counted based on number of then-authorized users for Software and number of seats or logins for Hosted Services (&quot;<strong>Authorized Users</strong>&quot;). End User designates Authorized Users through the Products. Authorized Users may include End User&#39;s employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, agents, and Customers (note: detailed rules for Customers in Section 4.4 below). End User may add Authorized Users for additional fees. End User is responsible for all use of the Products by its Authorized Users and their compliance with this Agreement.</p>
2. License to Use Crudzilla Software.

<p><strong>2.1 Software, Generally.</strong> Crudzilla grants End User a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable right to use the Software, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Software licenses are perpetual unless terminated as described in this Agreement. Only Authorized Users may use the Software, and only up to the permitted number of concurrent Authorized Users (except for Non-Production Purposes, as described below). All use of Software must be in accordance with the relevant Crudzilla documentation and policies. End User may make a limited number of copies of the Software as is strictly necessary for purposes of data protection, archiving, backup, and testing and internal development (e.g., of End User Modifications or End-User Plug-ins, as defined below, but not development of End User&#39;s unrelated products or services) (&quot;<strong>Non-Production Purposes</strong>&quot;). For clarity, End User&#39;s employees and contractors may use the Software for these Non-Production Purposes, and End User will be responsible for their compliance with this Agreement on all the same terms as for Authorized Users, except that these users will not count against End User&#39;s limit of Authorized Users, and End User will not need to pay additional fees for these users. Unless Crudzilla agrees otherwise in writing, End User may only install, use or make available the Software on End User&#39;s hardware systems, whether owned, leased or controlled. End User will be responsible for any use of the Software on any hardware systems not owned, leased or controlled by End User (&quot;<strong>Uncontrolled Systems</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Updates and Supplementary Software.</strong> The terms for Software in this Agreement apply to any Updates and Supplementary Software, unless Crudzilla provides different terms. Crudzilla may cease making available Supplementary Software and Internet-based services used with the Software at any time.</p>

<p><strong>2.3 Open Source Software.</strong> The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of &quot;open source&quot; software licenses (&quot;<strong>Open Source Software</strong>&quot;). To the extent required by the license that accompanies the Open Source Software, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Software, including any provisions governing access to source code, modification or reverse engineering.</p>

<p><strong>2.4 Evaluation Software.</strong> This paragraph applies to any Software that Crudzilla makes available on an evaluation basis (&quot;<strong>Evaluation Software</strong>&quot;). End User may only use the Evaluation Software for internal evaluation purposes for the period specified by Crudzilla (or, if not specified, for 30 days), and may only permit a limited number of users (specified by Crudzilla) to access the Evaluation Software. After the evaluation period, End User must delete all copies of the Evaluation Software. End User acknowledges that Evaluation Software may not be fully functional. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Crudzilla does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for any Evaluation Software.</p>

<p><strong>2.5 Source Code</strong>. Crudzilla may provide some elements of Software in source code form (&quot;<strong>Source Code</strong>&quot;). Unless otherwise specified, End User may modify Source Code solely to develop bug fixes, customizations, and additional features (&quot;End User Modifications&quot;) and, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, may only use End User Modifications internally for purposes of using the Software licensed from Crudzilla. Crudzilla will have no support, warranty, indemnity or other obligations relating to, and assumes no liability for, any End User Modifications or any effect they may have on the operation of the Products.</p>

<p><strong>2.6 IP Protection Mechanisms</strong>. The Software has license protection mechanisms designed to manage and protect Crudzilla&#39;s and its suppliers&#39; and licensors&#39; intellectual property rights. Whether using Source Code or not, End User must not modify or alter these mechanisms or try to circumvent them or the usage rules they are designed to enforce.</p>
<strong>3.0 LEFT BLANK</strong>

<h3>4. Important Customer Obligations</h3>

<p><strong>4.1 Accounts and Passwords.</strong> End User will provide accurate, current and complete information when registering with Crudzilla and ordering Products and agrees to update its information if it changes. This is important, because Crudzilla may send notices, statements and other information to End User by email or through End User&#39;s account (for Hosted Services). End User will keep all its Authorized Users&#39; passwords and usernames confidential and will not share them with third parties. End User is responsible for all actions taken through its accounts.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Embedded Software.</strong> All of the other restrictions for Software in this Agreement also apply to Embedded Software Software, with the addition of the following terms. End User receives restricted licenses to Embedded Software and may use Embedded Software only for its internal purposes (including for Customer Use as permitted below) in conjunction with the applicable Product as provided by Crudzilla, and may only use the Embedded Software as part of and through that Product. End User may not install, access, configure or use any Embedded Software (including any APIs, tools, databases or other components of any Embedded Software) separately or independently of the rest of the Product, whether for production, technical support or any other purposes, or otherwise attempt to gain direct access to any Embedded Software components, or permit anyone else (including Customers) to do any of these things. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, End User may not modify any Embedded Software. End User will be financially responsible to the applicable third party licensor (&quot;<strong>Embedded Software Licensor</strong>&quot;) for all damages and losses resulting from End User&#39;s or its Customers&#39; breach of this Agreement. End User may not &quot;benchmark&quot; or otherwise analyze performance information for individual Embedded Software elements.</p>

<p>Some Embedded Software may include source code provided as part of the Embedded Software Licensor&#39;s standard shipment. That source code will be governed by the terms for Embedded Software in this Agreement, and not the terms for Source Code in Section 2.5 (Source Code) above.</p>

<p>End User understands that the applicable Embedded Software Licensor retains all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Embedded Software. Embedded Software Licensors (and any other third party licensors of any components of the Products) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to the items they license and may enforce this Agreement directly against End User; but, to be clear, Embedded Software Licensor do not assume any of Crudzilla&#39;s obligations under this Agreement. In addition, End User agrees to the Embedded Software-related audit provisions in Section 6 (License Certifications and Audits) below.</p>

<p>Embedded Software may include or be accompanied by third party technology that may be appropriate or necessary for use with some Embedded Software. Such technology may be specified in the Documentation or otherwise specified by Crudzilla, and is licensed to End User only for use with the Product with which it is provided under the specified third party license terms, and not this Agreement. Crudzilla may also provide additional or substitute terms for Embedded Software if required by the Embedded Software Licensor, and End User will comply with those terms.</p>

<p><strong>4.3 Rules for Plug-ins.</strong> End User may develop its own plug-ins for various Products (&quot;<strong>End User Plug-ins</strong>&quot;) and may distribute End User Plug-ins to third parties, but only for those Products permitted by Crudzilla, and only in accordance with Crudzilla&#39;s published plug-in and API guidelines. End User Plug-ins distributed through the Crudzilla Marketplace will be subject to the posted terms for the Crudzilla Marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>4.4 Use by End User&#39;s Customers.</strong> End User&#39;s customers (&quot;<strong>Customers</strong>&quot;) may be Authorized Users. End User will be responsible for Customers the same as any other Authorized User and must enter into valid, binding agreements with Customers consistent with this Agreement, including the additional conditions below. A Customer&#39;s permitted use of Products under this Agreement is called &quot;<strong>Customer Use</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>In addition to all other terms in this Agreement, the following conditions apply to Customer Use:</p>

<p>(a) End User may not distribute or make available any Product on a standalone basis. Instead, End User may only make available the Product to Customers in order to support Customers&#39; use of content and features that are part of End User&#39;s own existing offerings. <em>Examples would include End User : (i) Distributing crud applications built on the CWAB platform, which would require the inclusion of CWAB crud execution engine;</em></p>

<p>(b) End User may not resell or OEM the Product or otherwise charge Customers for use of the Product itself, but may charge End Users as part of an overall program that includes access to End User content or features as supported by the Product, or crud applications built with the product.</p>

<p>(c) Customers may interact with the <em>CWAB crud execution engine only to modify application settings for a given crud application, however this may not involve using the CWAB product to make such changes</em>.</p>

<p>(d) In making available Products to Customers, End User may not violate any other term or condition in this Agreement, such as reverse engineering and anti-circumvention restrictions.</p>

<p>Crudzilla will not have any direct or indirect liability or obligation to any Customers, and Customers do not acquire any rights under this Agreement.</p>

<p>Crudzilla understands that Product usage may be flexible and that End Users may identify new proposed uses for the Products. If End User has questions about whether a proposed use complies with these rules, <strong>please contact Crudzilla at <a href="mailto:info@crudzilla.com?subject=EULA%20Related%20Question">info@crudzilla.com</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>4.5 Conditions on Use of Products.</strong> End User will not, and will not allow any Authorized User or other third party to: (a) resell, assign, rent, give, transfer, pass title to, lease, copy, provide access to or sublicense (including without limitation on a timeshare, subscription service, hosted service or outsourced basis) any Product to any third party (for use in its business operations or otherwise) or anyone else besides Authorized Users (including Customers) in accordance with this express terms of this Agreement, or permit anyone besides Authorized Users to use any data or information not owned by End User that is generated by the Products (and, in the event End User grants any security interest in any Products, the secured party has no right to use or transfer the Products); (b) use any Product to provide, or incorporate any Product into any product or service provided to, a third party, except as expressly permitted above for Customer Use; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decipher, decrypt, or otherwise seek to discover or obtain the source code or non-public APIs to Products (including any data structure or similar materials produced by the Products), except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law despite this prohibition (and then only upon advance notice to Crudzilla); (d) modify, adapt or create derivative works of a Product (excluding End User Modifications and End User Plug-ins); (e) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices of Crudzilla or any third party contained in any Product (including any information or data generated by the Products); (f) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of Products; (g) use any Product for commercial solicitation purposes or spam; (h) use the Crudzilla name or any Crudzilla trademarks or logos except as permitted in Section 4.6 (Attribution); or (i) commit any act or omission that could result in damage to Crudzilla&#39;s or its suppliers&#39; or licensors&#39; reputations. End User will not attempt to do any of the foregoing, encourage others to do so, or otherwise attempt to bypass or circumvent any usage restrictions in this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>4.6 Attribution.</strong> In any use of the Software, End User must include the following attribution to Crudzilla on all user interfaces in the following format: &quot;Powered by Crudzilla&quot;, which must in every case include a hyperlink to http://www.crudzilla.com, and which must be in the same format as delivered in the Software.</p>

<p><strong>4.7 Export Control.</strong> If a Product is acquired in U.S. by End User, End User must comply with all applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations administered by the U.S Department of Commerce (or any replacement department or authority). If a Product is acquired by End User in the United States, End User acknowledges that the Product is subject to U.S. export jurisdiction and agrees to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Product, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use, and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. In any case, the import and export of any Product may be subject to control or restriction by applicable local law. End User is solely responsible for determining the existence and application of any such law to any proposed import and export and for obtaining any needed authorization. End User agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any Product (or any direct product thereof) from any country in violation of applicable laws.</p>

<p><strong>4.8 Indemnification.</strong> End User will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Crudzilla from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any breach by End User (including any Authorized Users) of this Agreement, (b) any End User Data, (c) any End User Modifications, End User Plug-ins or other modifications of or combinations with a Product, or any service or product offered by End User in connection with or related to a Product, (d) any Uncontrolled Systems, or (e) any representations or warranties made by End User (including any Authorized User) regarding a Product to third parties. This indemnification obligation is subject to End User receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for End User to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim, provided that Crudzilla may participate in the claim at its own expense and End User may not settle any claim without Crudzilla&#39;s prior written consent; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Crudzilla at End User&#39;s expense.</p>

<h3>5. Fees and Payment</h3>

<p><strong>5.1 General.</strong> End User must pay all fees by their due date specified at the time of order or otherwise within 30 days of Crudzilla&#39;s invoice or notice. Renewal fees for Hosted Services will be charged as described in Section 3.2 (Subscription and Renewals). Late payments are subject to interest charges of 1.0% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is less, plus all collection expenses. End User will continue to be charged during any period of suspension. In event of any termination, End User will pay the unpaid balance due calculated in accordance with this section and this Agreement. Crudzilla may charge such unpaid fees and charges to End User&#39;s credit card or otherwise bill End User for such unpaid fees and charges. End User acknowledges that it is not relying on the future availability of any Products (including any Embedded Software) in agreeing to or making its payments hereunder.</p>

<p><strong>5.2 Taxes.</strong> Payments made by End User under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Crudzilla, End User must pay to Crudzilla the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, End User may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In that case, End User will have the right to provide to Crudzilla with any such exemption information and Crudzilla will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable End User to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.</p>

<p><strong>5.3 Special Terms for CWAB Paid AMI and EC2 Hosted Service.</strong> End Users of CWAB who wish to make use of the CWAB &quot;Paid AMI&quot; must complete a registration with Amazon Web Hosted Services (&quot;<strong>AWS</strong>&quot;) for Amazon&#39;s Elastic Cloud Hosted Service (EC2) (&quot;<strong>EC2 Hosted Service</strong>&quot;).&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, <strong>the EC2 Hosted Service is not part of the Hosted Services and fees paid to Crudzilla do not include fees for the EC2 Hosted Service</strong>. End Users using the EC2 Hosted Service will be charged directly by AWS and will be solely responsible for payment of all fees to AWS. Additional information is available on the EC2 Hosted Service and at: <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/overview/tour/scaling-up">http://www.crudzilla.com/software/paid-ami</a>, and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a>.</p>

<h3>6. License Certifications and Audits</h3>

<p>Upon Crudzilla&#39;s written request, End User will provide Crudzilla with a signed certification certifying that all Products are being used pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including any access and user limitations. With prior reasonable notice of at least ten (10) days, Crudzilla (or its authorized agent) may audit the use of the Products by End User and its Authorized Users and any Customers, provided such audit is during regular business hours. End User will provide reasonable assistance and access to information in the course of any audit. End User is responsible for such audit costs only in the event the audit reveals that End User&#39;s use of the Products is not in accordance with the permitted scope of use. In the event that any certification or audit reveals that End User has exceeded its permitted number of Authorized Users, Crudzilla may invoice End User for any past or ongoing excessive use and End User will pay the invoice in accordance with Section 5 (Fees and Payment). This remedy is without prejudice to any other remedies available to Crudzilla at law or equity or under this Agreement.</p>

<p>End User understands that Crudzilla may report audit results to any applicable Embedded Software Licensor or may assign the right to audit End User in this Section 6 to Embedded Software Licensors. When the audit is assigned, then notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, End User Licensor will not be responsible for End User&#39;s costs incurred in cooperating with the audit.</p>

<h3>7. Crudzilla&#39;s Ownership Rights; Feedback</h3>

<p>Crudzilla and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted to End User in this Agreement. The Products (including any content or information contained therein) and all copies thereof are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Crudzilla or its licensors own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Products and all copies, modifications and derivative works of the Products and underlying software (including any incorporating Feedback) (&quot;<strong>Crudzilla Technology</strong>&quot;), and End User does not acquire any ownership rights in Crudzilla Technology. All Products are licensed, not sold.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Feedback</strong>&quot; means any feedback, comments, suggestions or materials (including, to the extent disclosed to Crudzilla, any End User Modifications, but excluding End User Plug-ins) that End User may provide to Crudzilla about or in connection with the Products, including any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. End User may provide Feedback in connection with Maintenance and otherwise. End User hereby grants Crudzilla a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to use, copy, modify and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose, including incorporating or implementing the Feedback in the Products. End User agrees that Crudzilla may exploit all Feedback without any restriction or obligation on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise. For clarity, no Feedback will be deemed End User&#39;s Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement (including Section 8 (Confidentiality)) limits Crudzilla&#39;s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>

<h3>8. Confidentiality</h3>

<p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7 (Crudzilla&#39;s Ownership Rights; Feedback) above, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains (&quot;<strong>Receiving Party</strong>&quot;) from the disclosing party (&quot;<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>&quot;) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (&quot;<strong>Confidential Information</strong>&quot;), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Crudzilla Technology, performance information relating to the Products, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Crudzilla without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party&#39;s nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>

<h3>9. Termination</h3>

<p>This Agreement will continue so long as End User has a license to the Software or an ongoing Subscription Term for the Hosted Services, unless earlier terminated. Crudzilla may suspend or terminate this Agreement and End User&#39;s account, with respect to one or more of the Products, if End User fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any failure to pay fees when due. Crudzilla may terminate any free account or evaluation usage at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

<p>End User may terminate this Agreement at any time with notice to Crudzilla.</p>

<p>Immediately upon termination of any license or subscription right granted under this Agreement, End User&#39;s license to Software and Hosted Services will cease, and End User must at its own cost: (a) cease using (and require all Authorized Users, and anyone else to cease using) all the terminated Products; (b) remove all copies of Software from its computer systems and any Uncontrolled Systems; and (c) return to Crudzilla all Software or provide Crudzilla with written certification that it has destroyed all copies of the Software and other Crudzilla Confidential Information in its possession, custody or control. Upon termination of this Agreement for whatever reason, End User will not be entitled to credits or refunds for any unused portion of this Agreement, including but not limited to unused maintenance and support.</p>

<p>All payment and other obligations accrued as of the date of any expiration or termination of this Agreement, and Sections 4.5 (Conditions on Use of Products), 4.7 (Export Control), 4.8 (Indemnification), 5 (Fees and Payment), 6 (License Certifications and Audit), 7 (Crudzilla&#39;s Ownership Rights; Feedback); 8 (Confidentiality), 9 (Termination), 11 (Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Publicity Rights) 14 (Assignment), 15 (Governing Law and Arbitration), 16 (DMCA Notices), 17 (Government End Users) and 18 (General) will survive expiration or termination.</p>

<h3>10. Crudzilla Infringement Indemnification</h3>

<p>Subject to the remainder of this Section 10, Crudzilla will indemnify, defend and hold End User harmless against a claim to the extent based on an allegation that End User&#39;s use of a Product (in the form provided by Crudzilla) in compliance with this Agreement infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright (&quot;Claim&quot;), and will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against End User by a court of competent jurisdiction, or agreed to in writing by Crudzilla as settlement, as a result of such Claim, provided that Crudzilla is (i) promptly notified and furnished a copy of such Claim, (ii) given all relevant evidence in End User&#39;s possession, custody or control, and (iii) given reasonable assistance in and sole control of the defense thereof and all negotiations for its settlement. Crudzilla will have no obligation to defend and no liability for any damages or costs to the extent that a Claim is based upon: (i) use of a Product in combination with any non-Crudzilla product, software or equipment; (ii) use of a Product in a manner or for an application other than for which it was designed or intended to be used, regardless of whether Crudzilla was aware of or had been advised of such use; (iii) modifications to a Product by any person or entity other than Crudzilla (including any End User Modifications); or (iv) other circumstances or occurrences that are covered in End User&#39;s indemnification obligations in Section 4.8.</p>

<p>If a Product becomes, or in the opinion of Crudzilla may become, the subject of a Claim, Crudzilla may, at its option and in its discretion: (i) procure for End User the right to use the Product free of any liability; (ii) replace or modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) terminate End User&#39;s right to continue using such Product and refund, in the case of Software, any license fees related to this Software paid by End User (depreciated on a three-year straight line basis) or, in the case of a Hosted Service, any prepaid amounts for the service no longer being provided.</p>

<p>This Section 10 states the sole liability of Crudzilla and the exclusive remedy of End User for any infringement of intellectual property rights in connection with any Product or other items provided by Crudzilla under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>11. Warranties; Disclaimers of Warranties</h3>

<p><strong>11.1 General.</strong> Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that, if End User is an entity, this Agreement and each order is entered into by an employee or agent of such party with all necessary authority to bind such party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>18. General</h3>

<p>This Agreement is the entire agreement between End User and Crudzilla relating to the Products and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Products or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as described on the first page of this Agreement or otherwise with the written agreement of Crudzilla (which may be withheld in its complete discretion without any requirement to provide reasons). As used herein, &quot;including&quot; (and its variants) means &quot;including without limitation&quot; (and its variants). If either party to this Agreement breaches any provision of this Agreement relating to Confidential Information or intellectual property rights, there may not be an adequate remedy available solely at law; therefore, an injunction, specific performance or other form of equitable relief or monetary damages or any combination thereof may be sought by the injured party to this Agreement. No failure or delay by the injured party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder at law or equity. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create any duty or obligation of the other party.</p>
